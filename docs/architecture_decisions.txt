The Global architecture is microservices oriented.
I consider the "UdaConnect API" to be the entry point from the frontend.
The API will be Using 3 services:
- Person Service which transfers the person data to kafka cluster and postgreSQL
- Connection Service which transfer the connection data to the postgresSQL
- Location Service which transfers the person data to kafka cluster and postgreSQL

Since writes are more expensive than writes. Kafka Cluster is mostly used the handle write requests. This will help to scale when the traffic gets really high,
providing high availability in the write requests.

It's also wise to consider gRPC for (get requests for example), since gRPC are 7-10times faster than RestFul APIs.
